## project structure

The project structure is simple and clear. The lib folder is the core of the project.
Another important foler is the test folder which can help us understand how to run tests and how the postcss api works.

## entry point analysis from package.json

### main Field

- Purpose: The main field specifies the primary entry point for the package. When a user imports or requires the package, this is the file that will be loaded by default.
- Example: In the package.json, the main field is set to "./lib/postcss.js". This means that if someone uses require('postcss') in a CommonJS environment, Node.js will load ./lib/postcss.js.
- Usage: This field is essential for backward compatibility and ensures that the package works as expected in environments that do not support modern module resolution mechanisms.

### exports Field

- Purpose: The exports field provides a way to define conditional and context-aware entry points for the package. It allows the package to specify different entry points for different environments (like CommonJS, ES modules, browser, etc.) and to hide internal modules from external use.
- Example: In the package.json, the exports field is structured as follows:

```
"exports": {
  ".": {
    "require": "./lib/postcss.js",
    "import": "./lib/postcss.mjs"
  },
  "./lib/at-rule": "./lib/at-rule.js",
  "./lib/comment": "./lib/comment.js",
  // ... other exports
}
The "." key specifies the main entry point for the package. It differentiates between require (for CommonJS) and import (for ES modules).
Other keys like "./lib/at-rule", "./lib/comment", etc., provide specific entry points for individual modules within the package. This allows users to import these modules directly, like import atRule from 'postcss/lib/at-rule'.
```

- Usage: This field is particularly useful for modern JavaScript environments that support ES modules and conditional exports. It helps in optimizing the package for different use cases and ensures that only intended modules are exposed to users, improving encapsulation and maintainability.

#### What if it does not specify "./lib/at-rule": "./lib/at-rule.js", what would happen?

If the exports field in the package.json does not specify "./lib/at-rule": "./lib/at-rule.js", then the import statement import atRule from 'postcss/lib/at-rule' will not work as expected in environments that strictly adhere to the exports field for module resolution.

##### Behavior in Different Environments

1. Modern Environments (ES Modules):

In environments that support ES modules and respect the exports field, attempting to import postcss/lib/at-rule without a corresponding entry in the exports field will result in an error. This is because the exports field explicitly defines which modules are allowed to be imported.

2. Legacy Environments (CommonJS):

In older environments that use CommonJS and do not support the exports field, the behavior might differ. If the environment does not enforce the exports field, it might still attempt to resolve the module by directly accessing the file system path postcss/lib/at-rule. However, this behavior is not guaranteed and can vary between different tools and environments.

In summary, if the exports field does not specify "./lib/at-rule": "./lib/at-rule.js", the import statement import atRule from 'postcss/lib/at-rule' will not work in environments that strictly adhere to the exports field for module resolution.

#### summary

The exports field takes precedence over the main field. However, the exports field is only recognized by Node.js that supports ES6. To maintain compatibility with older versions of Node.js, the main field can be used in conjunction with the exports field.

- The exports field is prioritized over the main field in environments that support it.
- The exports field is specifically recognized by Node.js versions that support ES6.
- To ensure backward compatibility with older Node.js versions, the main field should be used in conjunction with the exports field.

This approach allows package maintainers to leverage the advanced features of the exports field while ensuring that their package remains accessible to a wide range of users, including those using older versions of Node.js.

## Dependencies

## nanoid

Nanoid is used to generate unique identifiers, just like uuid. However, nanoid is challenging the existence of uuid. Its features is as follows. (https://blog.bitsrc.io/why-is-nanoid-replacing-uuid-1b5100e62ed2)

- smaller and faster than uuid
- more secure
- no third party reliance
- compatibility

### Example Usage

```
const { nanoid } = require('nanoid');

// Generate a default 21-character unique ID
const id = nanoid();
console.log(id); // Example output: "V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B-myT"
```

## picocolors

picocolors is a lightweight library for adding color and formatting to text in the console or terminal. Its primary purpose is to enhance the readability and aesthetics of command-line interfaces (CLIs) by providing a simple way to apply color and style to output text.

### Example Usage

```
const pc = require('picocolors');

console.log(pc.red('This text is red!'));
console.log(pc.bold(pc.green('This text is bold and green!')));
console.log(pc.underline(pc.blue('This text is underlined and blue!')));
```

## source-map-js

source-map-js is a powerful and essential library for working with source maps in JavaScript. It provides tools for generating, consuming, and manipulating source maps, making it easier to debug and maintain code that has been transformed by various build tools. Its performance and compatibility with the Source Map Revision 3 Proposal make it a valuable asset for developers working with modern JavaScript development workflows.

## Development Tools

Robust development tools are used, including ESLint for linting, C8 for coverage, and Prettier for code formatting.

## Testing and Quality

Comprehensive testing scripts are in place, including type checking, coverage, integration, and size checking.
